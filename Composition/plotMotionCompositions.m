%********************* Documentation **************************************
% This function LABELS the plot of primitives with composition labels. 
% The set of compositions include: (alignment, increase, decrease, constant)
% and represendted by the strings: ('a','i','d','c').
% 
% Positioning of Labels:
% The dependent axis is time. The average time between two primitives that
% have been compounded together is used to set the x-position of the label.
%
% The y-position is set 
% 
% Text Labeling:
% The text labeling is performed by extracting the first category or
% element of the CELL ARRAY motComps of type string. 
%
% motComps:     - [actionClass,avgVal,rmsVal,AmplitudeVal,p1label,p2label,t1Start,t1End,t2Start,t2End,tavgIndex]
%
% Output Parameters:
% htext         - handle to the text objects in case user wants to modify
%
% Modifications:
% July 2012 - to facilitate the conversion from Matlab to C++ all cells
% have been eliminated. All {} were converted to ()
